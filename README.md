#Challenge 1

## Description
The puropose of this project was to improve Horiseon Social Solution Services splash page so that it follows accessibility standards and can be optimized for search engines (especially given the later is the work of Horiseon). The work done to it was the following: 

1) I inclued alt text was for images as much as possible.  This was for the three photos in the "content" section and the three icons in the "benefits" section. The main exception was the image used as a background image in the CSS file which wasn't included in the original html file.   

2) The original htmls file lacked a great deal of semantic html elements which much of the page divided into <div>s.  I converted a majority of <div>s to semantic elements, but left much of the classes as is.  In the CSS file I removed many redundant css declarations, by assinging selectors that shared the same declarations.  

3) In the navigation section, "Search Engine Optimization" did not link down to its section in the "content" section.  I added a class so that the connection between the two worked. 

4) Previously the page was titled "webpage," and I changed it to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" since the page is the companies representation on the internet. 

The index.html file is at the same level as this README.md file.  The style.css can be reached by first entering the "assets" folder and then going another level down in the "css" folder.  All the images are in the /assets/images/ folder.
