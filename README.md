#Challenge 1

## Description
The puropose of this project was to improve Horiseon Social Solution Services splash page so that it follows accessibility standards and can be optimized for search engines (especially given search engine optimization is what Horiseon does). The work I did was the following: 

1. I inclued alt text for images as much as possible.  This was for the three photos in the "content" section and the three icons in the "benefits" section. The main exception was the image used as a background image in the CSS file which wasn't included semantically in the original html file.   

2. The original html file almost lacked semantic html elements completely.  Much of the page, however, was divided into "div"s.  I converted a majority of "div"s to semantic elements, but left much of the classes as they were.  In the CSS file I removed many redundant css declarations, by assinging multiple selectors to one set of declarations where previously they each had their own.   

3. In the navigation section, "Search Engine Optimization" did not link down to its section in the "content" section.  I added a class so that the connection between the two worked. 

4. Previously the page was titled "webpage." I changed it to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" since the page is the company's main representation on the internet the company's name is a good description of the page. 

The index.html file is at the same level as this README.md file.  The style.css can be reached by first entering the "assets" folder and then going another level down in the "css" folder.  All the images are in the /assets/images/ folder.
